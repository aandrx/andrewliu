**Hey, I’m Andrew!**

I’m a senior studying Computer Science at Georgia Tech and an incoming Product Manager at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) in New York City. I like working at the intersection of tech, policy, and design to solve challenges in security and sustainable development. 

I’m interested in responsible AI, security and privacy, and computational linguistics. I'm currently building Fair Data Project, an organization that teaches people about tech ethics.

Previously, I interned as a Product Manager for three summers at Microsoft. I also worked on research for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, where I designed and developed an infrastructure risk assessment modeling & simulation software.

In my free time, I like [taking photos](https://www.instagram.com/shirlingpics/), [filmmaking](https://www.youtube.com/c/shirlingxu), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55404997-shirling-xu), [writing](https://medium.com/@shirlingxu), long-distance running, hiking, and trying new cafes and restaurants.
